// Converting strings into integers without built in functions

// The ASCII character ‘0’ is represented by 48 (decimal)

// The ASCII character ‘9’ is represented by 57 (decimal)

// The ASCII characters ‘1’–’8′ are between them…

// So, '7' - '0' is exactly the same operation as 55 - 48, so you get a 7…

const newNum = '2' - '0';
console.log(typeof newNum)
